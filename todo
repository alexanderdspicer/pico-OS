# README
- [ ] Write README
# general
- [ ] convert all files to space-tabs (might make me a sinner, oh well)
# usb.c
- [ ] Finish implementing USB driver
- [ ] Posture for additional USB support of hubs, ethernet adapters, audio outputs, and mass storage devices
- [ ] Steal extra RAM from USB buffer?
# compilation
- [ ] Implement the following:
    | The OS              |
    |---------------------|
    | usb                 |
    | system vars         |
    | sound               |
    | console             |
    | commands            |
    | filesystem          |
    | networking          | 
    | memory alloc        |
    | 2d rendering engine |
- [ ] Compile Flags:
    - [ ] 'COLOR_MODE': indicates the bit-"ness" of the palette used by the display code, i.g. '888', '565', '555' etc.
    - [ ] 'NETWORKING': indicates whether or not the binary should be built with networking support
        - [ ] 'NETWORKING_USB': specifies USB Networking only
            (Not recommended in conjunction with USB Sound)
        - [ ] 'NETWORKING_WIFI': specifies Wireless Networking only
        - [ ] 'NETWORKING_I2C': specifies I2C Networking only
    - [ ] 'SOUND': indicates whether or not the binary should be built with sound support
        - [ ] 'SOUND_USB': specifies Sound over USB 
            (Not recommended in conjunction with USB Networking)
        - [ ] 'SOUND_I2S': specifies Sound over I2S
        - [ ] 'SOUND_PWM': specifies Sound over PWM
    - [ ] 'HEADLESS': indicates whether or not the binary should be built with display functionality
# multicore work
- [ ] The follwing in highest to lowest order of Core 0 priority
    - USB handling, Including:
        - Filesystem
        - Potentially Networking and Sound
    - Networking
    - 2D rendering engine
    - Sound
- [ ] *Most* program specific work delegated to Core 1 (special exceptions may apply)
# filesystem
- [ ] Posture for filesystem & SquashFs Compression (of as of yet determined variety) support
- [ ] Posture additionally for FAT32 file system support for the aforementioned mass storage devices (4gb should be more than enough)
- [ ] When decompressing a SquashFs file, use 4KB blocks such that each block may be loaded into SRAM 4 and/or 5 so that decompression is less likely to interupt DMA requests. Both 4 & 5 are likely to be used at startup to speed up loading the initial RamDisk
- [ ] Level data exclusively in Flash? (~12Mbytes/s) or in USB MSD? (~12Mbits/s)
- [ ] No XIP Cache?
# networking
- [ ] I2C, USB, Pico W support (Bluetooth, Wifi)
- [ ] Use Alarms for network timeout
